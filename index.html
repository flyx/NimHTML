                    <h2>Project Status</h2>
                    <p>This was my very first Nim project, the goal was to test the versatility of Nim's macro system. It worked quite well.</p>
                    <p>Since I never went on to actually do something with it, this is now just code I myself do not really know anymore. I also don't have the time to maintain the project, so it is <strong>unmaintained</strong>. Use at your own risk.</p>

                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>emerald</strong>
 is a Nim library for writing                         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML 5</a>
 templates. It is implemented as a domain-specific language
                        that can be used directly in your Nim source code via macros.
                        Features include:                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>HTML validation</strong>
: emerald validates your HTML
                            structure when it compiles your template. This validation
                            checks for unknown, ill-placed and missing HTML tags and
                            attributes, but does not implement the whole HTML 5 spec. It
                            is a tool for you to discover errors early.                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mixins</strong>
: You can re-use parts of your template
                            code by placing it in mixins and calling the mixin from the
                            template. emerald is able to check the whole resulting HTML
                            structure.                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Filtering</strong>
: By default, emerald converts
                            special HTML characters in the content it outputs to their
                            corresponding entities, but you can customize the whole
                            filter chain and also write your own filters.                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Inheritance</strong>
: Templates can inherit from other
                            templates. You can define your base structure in a master
                            template, and add content with child templates. emerald is
                            still able to check the whole resulting HTML structure.                        </li>
                    </ul>
